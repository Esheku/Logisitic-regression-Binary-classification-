# Logisitic-regression-Binary-classification
Binary classification ultimately categorizes data into 0 and 1. The goal of logistic regression here is to take the binary output interpreting it as probabilities of each class of dataset.

### The Dataset
The CSV file contains age and bought insurance data. The data set for this exercise can be found at [Insurance dataset](https://github.com/codebasics/py/blob/master/ML/7_logistic_reg/insurance_data.csv). The link to the video training can be found at [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zM4VZR0px8E&t=922s)

### Library Used
The various libraries used in Jyupiter notebook are as follows
```ruby
  pandas as pd
  eaborn as sb
  matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  sklearn.model_selection
  sklearn.linear_model
```
### Probability Report
From the model in `Insurance Data Logistic Regression.ipynb` it shows that the older the person, the higher the probability of using a life insurance.
